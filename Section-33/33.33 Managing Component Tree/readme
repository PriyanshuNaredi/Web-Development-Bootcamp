# To-Do List Application

This project is a simple To-Do List application built with React. It allows users to add and delete tasks from a list.

## Components

### App.jsx
- Manages the state of the application including the list of items and the input text.
- Contains functions to handle changes in the input field, add items to the list, and delete items from the list.
- Renders the input field, add button, and the list of `TodoItem` components.

#### Functions in App.jsx
- `handleChange(event)`: Updates the `inputText` state with the current value of the input field.
- `addItem()`: Adds the current `inputText` to the `items` array and clears the input field.
- `deleteItem(id)`: Removes the item with the specified `id` from the `items` array.

### ToDoItem.jsx
- Represents a single to-do item.
- Receives props from the `App` component including the text of the item, its id, and a function to handle item deletion.
- Calls the `onChecked` function passed as a prop when the item is clicked, passing its id to delete the item.

#### Functions in ToDoItem.jsx
- The `onClick` event handler: Calls the `onChecked` function passed as a prop, providing the `id` of the item to be deleted.
